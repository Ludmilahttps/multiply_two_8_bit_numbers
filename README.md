# multiply_two_8_bit_numbers

This project is a program that multiplies two 8-bit numbers. This working with assembly in 8085. (so fun when being tortured)

# About
 - The numbers (in hexadecimal) must be positive (unsigned) integers. In decimal, this means that the numbers are in the range between 0 and 255.
 - The numbers to be multiplied must be in input ports 00H and 01H.
 - The 8 LSB of the result will be written to the output port 00H, while the 8 MSB to the exit 01H.
 - The program works correctly when one of the numbers is equal to zero.

# OBS
This web site is a replica, using Assembly
To open this program it is necessary to clone the repository, install the 8085 simulator and run the repository in the simulator.
